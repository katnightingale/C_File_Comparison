# C_File_Comparison
This is a program that takes two files (names hard-coded) and compares them, character by character. It then outputs the percentage of mismatches, as well as the percentage of non-tested characters.  Allows for users to choose whether to test for case sensitivity and whether or not to compare punctuation.
